This project is for showing who enters the room when the rasberry pi sensor is working. It uses a rasberry pi, camera and Parallax Inc PIR Sensor Module Mfr. Part No.28032. Images are displayed on a public website on glitch and are also stored in firebase with notifications of motion detected sent via email and blynk notifications.
The glitch website was coded using javascript/html/css.
The RPI program was coded using python.
In documentation it includes intructions for a PIR sensor that is similar to one I used and the instructions work the same for it.
